# wait-for

This action will wait for another job in the workflow to complete.

## Development

As is standard for JS GitHub Actions if you edit this action (`index.js`) then you must run `npm run package` to rebuild `dist/index.js`. You must commit both index.js and dist/index.js. The GitHub Action runs dist/index.js.
